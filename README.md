# ⚡ FastReactApp

A modern fullstack application that seamlessly connects a **React** frontend with a **FastAPI** backend, containerized using **Docker** and orchestrated with **Docker Compose**.

---

## 🌐 Functionality Overview

- 🧠 **API-Driven Architecture**  
  The React frontend fetches data from a FastAPI backend using a clean RESTful endpoint.

- 🚀 **Live Interaction**  
  On page load, the frontend sends a request to the backend and dynamically displays the response.

- 🔄 **Asynchronous Communication**  
  Powered by `fetch` API to handle backend communication without page reloads.

- 🐳 **Fully Containerized Setup**  
  Both services (frontend + backend) run inside isolated Docker containers for consistency and ease of deployment.

- 🔗 **Seamless Integration**  
  Built to ensure smooth interaction across services using CORS-enabled communication.

## ✅ How It Works

1. The user visits the web app.
2. The React frontend sends an HTTP request to the FastAPI backend.
3. The backend responds with a friendly message.
4. The frontend displays the message dynamically.
